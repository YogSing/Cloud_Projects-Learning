# Provisioners in the Terraform

### Use case of provisioners in the Terraform
- `local-exec.tf`: Cmd used to run locally where Terraform is executed such as for the time stamp of deployment.
  
   ``` tf
   provisioner "local-exec" {
   command = "echo 'Deployment started at ${timestamp()}' > deployment-${replace(timestamp(), ":", "-")}.log"
   }
   ```
- `remote-exec` : Cmd used to run remotely on the target machine for example linux vm
  
  ``` tf
   provisioner "remote-exec" {
    ///code and connections
  }
  ```
- `file` : Cmd used to copy files from local machine to target machine
  
  ```tf
  provisioner "file" {
  source      = "configs/sample.txt"
  destination = "/home/adminuser/sample.txt"
  connection{ } }
  ```
### Terraform/tf files 
- `main.tf` : This file has a configuration of VM, vnet, subnet, NSG, provisioner etc
- `provider.tf`: This is file to declare provider info
- `ssh_key` : This folder is the module to generate public and private keys.
-  `deployment***` These files are generated by local-exec provisioner to show the case time stamp of the resource before and after 
     deployment.
